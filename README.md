Here's a short application user flow walkthrough. The screenshots present screens 320px wide, followed by 768px wide and lastly 1440px wide.

### Step 1
When the user arrives at the start page, the bot introduces itself and asks the user to define recipe search preferences. Course preferences are asked as the first search term. The user can skip this by pressing the 'Next' button.

### Step 6
This step can return two different views.

##### View 1 - the results page
If Yummly API has recipes listed with terms matching the user's entered preferences, the user will see a list of recipes under the chatbox. Then the user can click/tap on any of the returned results and that opens a lightbox view of the recipe with more detailed results and references to the original recipe source and Yummly recipe page. User can also share the recipe on their Facebook feed.

##### View 2 - no results
If the Yummly has no recipes listed with defined preferences, the user is notified and they can start a new search by clicking on the 'Start new search' link at the end of the bot's last message.
